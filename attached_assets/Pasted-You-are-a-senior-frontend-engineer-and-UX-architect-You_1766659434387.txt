You are a senior frontend engineer and UX architect. Your task is to refactor, enhance, and polish an existing Medical Insurance Verification web app without changing its core business logic.

⸻

1. CONTEXT

This is an internal HR self-service portal used by employees to:
	•	Review medical insurance details (self + dependents)
	•	Confirm accuracy OR request corrections
	•	Submit correction requests before a deadline

The app already exists. Your job is visual clarity, usability, consistency, and minor UX logic improvements — not a rebuild.

⸻

2. DESIGN DIRECTION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Visual Style
	•	Clean, enterprise, minimal
	•	White-dominant UI
	•	Dark navy header (existing brand)
	•	Soft grey dividers and shadows
	•	Rounded cards (8–12px radius)
	•	No flashy animations

Color Tokens
	•	Primary: #1E1B5C (existing navy)
	•	Secondary: muted slate / grey
	•	Success: subtle green
	•	Warning: amber
	•	Error: muted red (not aggressive)

⸻

3. LAYOUT & STRUCTURE CHANGES

A. Header (Sticky)
	•	Left: App icon +
Medical Insurance Verification
Employee Self-Service Portal
	•	Right:
	•	Pill badge: Policy Year 2026
	•	User block:
	•	Employee Name
	•	Employee Number (small, muted)
	•	Sign Out (right aligned, not oversized)

⸻

B. Status Strip (Below Header)
Single horizontal info bar:
	•	⏱ Session timeout: 15 min
	•	📅 Deadline: 31 January 2026 (XX days left)

Use icons + muted background.

⸻

C. Employee Snapshot (Read-Only Card)
Two-column layout:

Left:
	•	Employee Number
	•	Employee Name

Right:
	•	Job Title
	•	Department

This card must be visually distinct but compact.

⸻

4. COVERED MEMBERS SECTION (KEY IMPROVEMENTS)

A. Member Cards
Each covered member must appear as a separate card:

Header:
	•	Member Name
	•	Relationship badge:
	•	PRINCIPAL (blue)
	•	SPOUSE / CHILD (soft pink / neutral)

Body (2-column grid):
	•	Date of Birth
	•	Gender
	•	Nationality
	•	Emirates ID
	•	Passport Status

Rules:
	•	If missing → show “Not provided” in muted red
	•	Emirates ID should be visually formatted (grouped digits)

⸻

5. CONFIRMATION LOGIC (IMPORTANT)

A. Radio Selection (Mandatory)
User must choose ONE:
	•	✅ I confirm all information above is accurate
	•	✏️ I need to request corrections

Behavior:
	•	If confirmed → show green confirmation state + enable final submit
	•	If correction selected → dynamically reveal correction section

No page reloads.

⸻

6. CORRECTION REQUEST UX (CRITICAL FIXES)

A. Dependent Selection
	•	Dropdown: “Select dependent to correct”
	•	Auto-populate current values as read-only placeholders

B. Fields to Correct
	•	Editable fields only:
	•	Name
	•	Date of Birth
	•	Emirates ID
	•	Passport Number
	•	Relationship

Rules:
	•	User fills only the fields that need correction
	•	Empty fields must NOT overwrite existing data

⸻

C. Validation
	•	At least ONE field must be edited
	•	Emirates ID format validation
	•	DOB must be valid (no future dates)

Show inline validation messages — no alerts.

⸻

D. Remarks
	•	Free-text but required
	•	Placeholder examples:
	•	“Spelling correction”
	•	“Emirates ID renewed”
	•	“Passport recently issued”

⸻

7. SUBMISSION & FEEDBACK

After submission:
	•	Disable form
	•	Show confirmation message:
“Your correction request has been submitted to HR for review.”

Optional:
	•	Reference number (if already supported)

⸻

8. ACCESSIBILITY & QUALITY
	•	Proper label/input association
	•	Keyboard navigable
	•	Mobile responsive (tablet priority)
	•	No console errors
	•	No breaking existing API calls

⸻

9. WHAT NOT TO DO
	•	Do NOT introduce authentication changes
	•	Do NOT redesign backend
	•	Do NOT over-engineer
	•	Do NOT add unnecessary animations

⸻

10. DELIVERABLE

Update the existing frontend code to:
	•	Improve layout
	•	Improve clarity
	•	Improve correction workflow
	•	Keep logic intact
	•	Be production-ready

⸻

Start by reviewing the current UI structure, then apply changes incrementally.
