🎯 Objective

Standardise the Pass architecture so that Candidate Pass behaves exactly like Manager Pass, using the same interaction model, layout rules, and content swapping logic.

The Manager Pass is the reference implementation.

🔒 CANONICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All Passes must follow the same structural contract:

Fixed Pass shell

Bottom menu = internal tab switch

Content renders inside the pass

No page routing

No expand-down sections

If it doesn’t behave like Manager Pass → it’s wrong.

🧱 PASS STRUCTURE (REFERENCE: Manager Pass)
PassContainer (fixed)
 ├─ Header
 │   ├─ Title / Role
 │   ├─ Department
 │   ├─ Status + SLA
 │   └─ KPI cards
 ├─ ContentArea   ← swaps based on activeTab
 └─ BottomMenu    ← fixed, always visible


👉 This exact structure must be reused for Candidate Pass

🧠 ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENT

Implement state-driven rendering, identical to Manager Pass.

Example:

activeTab = 'pipeline' | 'docs' | 'setup' | 'calendar' | 'hr'


For Candidate Pass:

activeTab = 'home' | 'documents' | 'calendar' | 'engage'


NO routes

NO accordions

NO scroll-based expansion

🔁 APPLY THIS TO CANDIDATE PASS
Candidate Pass must mirror Manager Pass behavior:
Aspect	Manager Pass (Current)	Candidate Pass (Required)
Shell	Fixed	Fixed
Menu	Tab-based	Tab-based
Content	Internal swap	Internal swap
Scroll	Inside content only	Inside content only
Calendar	Embedded	Embedded
HR / Contact	Embedded	Embedded
📑 MENU CONTENT (CANDIDATE PASS)
1. Home

Journey

Stage & status

Action Required (persistent CTA zone)

Activity History (collapsed, read-only)

2. Documents

Document list

Upload / download

Same layout behavior as Manager “Docs”

3. Calendar

Use Manager Pass Calendar layout as UX reference, adapted for candidates.

Split-view layout inside ContentArea:

LEFT

Monthly calendar

Interview indicators

RIGHT

Interview details panel:

No interview → empty state

Scheduled → full interview info

❌ No full-page calendar
❌ No expanding sections

4. Engage

Equivalent to Manager “HR” tab:

Contact HR

Submit feedback

View previous communications (candidate-visible only)

🎯 ACTIONS REQUIRED (ALIGNMENT)
Placement

Add Action Required section:

Below Journey (Candidate)

Equivalent in importance to Manager SLA indicator

Rules

One primary action at a time

Auto-derived from stage & status

Clicking action logs ActivityLog entry

🧾 ACTIVITY LOG (SYSTEM-WIDE, ALL PASSES)
Backend (MANDATORY)

Single shared ActivityLog table for:

Candidate Pass

Manager Pass

HR actions

System events

Structure:

ActivityLog
- id
- entity_type (candidate | requisition | interview)
- entity_id
- stage
- action_type
- action_description
- performed_by (candidate | manager | HR | system)
- performed_by_id
- timestamp
- visibility (internal | candidate)

👁️ VISIBILITY RULES
Manager Pass

Full visibility

All actions

All metadata

Candidate Pass

Only visibility = candidate

Displayed under:
Home → Activity History (collapsed)

🚫 STRICTLY DISALLOWED (ANY PASS)

Downward-expanding menus

Page-based navigation

Mixed content visibility

History shown as a primary screen

Different interaction models per pass

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Candidate Pass behaves identically to Manager Pass

Menu clicks swap content only

Calendar stays inside pass

Action Required is always visible when applicable

Every meaningful action writes to ActivityLog

Deliverable

Refactor Candidate Pass to fully comply with the Manager Pass interaction model and shared Activity Log system. Reuse existing styling and components wherever possible.

Strategic Note (important)

You are not building screens.
You are building a Pass Framework.
